        <h1>You Should Get Your Fence Painted</h1>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Ugly gray keeps happiness away</h2>
        <p>Your fence surrounds everything in your yard. Does lively landscaping actually matter if everything around it is a lifeless gray?</p>
        <p>By changing the color of the fence to match the house and yard, you can give new life to the atmosphere your backyard creates.</p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Unprotected fences can get gross fast</h2>
        <p>Efflorescence -- the arch nemesis of block fences -- is that ugly white salt that you've seen accumulated on outdoor walls. When moisture causes it to seep out of its dark hiding place in your fence's concrete, it can become a disastrous blemish on an otherwise beautiful backyard.</p>
        <p>Our painting process includes treating the fence with a sealant that is designed to keep the ugly salt away by preventing rain and other sources of moisture from seeping through the cracks. With the efflorescence at bay, the kids can come out to play!</p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">It's probably more affordable than you think</h2>
        <p>Overhauling your backyard is <i>always</i> an expensive undertaking. Landscaping will have you paying out your nose, laying tile or brick can cost an arm and a leg, and don't even think about building a patio or installing a pool.</p>
        <p>Getting your fence painted can make your backyard feel brand new at a fraction of the cost. We use a simple pricing model based on the size and type of your fence, and we hand out free quotes like candy on Halloween. </p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Longevity and low effort</h2>
        <p>Our fence paint jobs are designed to last for 5-10 years with 0 maintenance required from the home owner.</p>
        <p>To demonstrate our confidence, we offer a 5 year grace period. At any point during that time period, if you notice a deterioration of paint quality due to normal wear and tear, we'll come and touch it up for you.. FOR FREE.</p>
